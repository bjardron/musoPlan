# Version Control System Research Report

## Introduction

As part of my endeavor to streamline code management and enhance collaborative efforts within my project, I conducted an in-depth investigation into various Version Control Systems (VCS). Git, with its distributed architecture, emerged as the optimal choice for its scalability, robustness, and versatile branching mechanisms.

## Different Types of VCS Investigated

In the pursuit of the most suitable VCS for my project, I evaluated several systems. These included centralized VCS like Subversion (SVN) and decentralized ones like Git and Mercurial. The distributed nature of Git, coupled with its extensive branching capabilities, provided the flexibility and scalability required for my project's diverse needs.

## Git Alignment with Organizational Requirements

Git's adaptability perfectly suits my project's size and team structure. Its decentralized architecture fosters autonomy among team members while ensuring efficient code management and version control. Installation and configuration were seamless, aligning precisely with my organizational needs for traceability and accountability.
